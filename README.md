# Sentimental
*Sentiment analysis made easy; built on top off solid libraries.*

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sentimental.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sentimental)

Sentimental uses *Scikit-learn* to perform easy sentiment analysis. The idea is to create a simple out-of-box solution that yields acceptable results without complex configuration. Sentimental also uses a simple format for its training corpora that makes it easy to add more training data.

Sentimental labels a sentence either: positive, neutral or negative together with the probability.

Take a look at [sentimental/data](./sentimental/data) for the included training corpora.

## Usage
Sentimental is released as a python package, just run:
```bash
pip install sentimental
```

### Examples
Below are some simple examples that covers most functions and use cases.

#### Extracting example sentences from a corpus
Using lists of negative and positive words Sentimental can extract files containing positive, neutral and negative sentences.
```python
from sentimental import ExampleExtractor, get_data_path

e = ExampleExtractor()
e.load_labeled_words(get_data_path() + '/sv/lexicon/positive_examples.txt', 'positive')
e.load_labeled_words(get_data_path() + '/sv/lexicon/negative_examples.txt', 'negative')
e.extract_examples(get_data_path() + '/sv/_newcorpus/corpus.txt', 'data/sv/_newcorpus')
```

#### Training a model from example sentences
Once you have a lists of positive, negative and neutral sentences you can train the Sentimental model on them to make prediction on other sentences.
```python
from sentimental import Sentimental

sentimental = Sentimental()
sentimental.train(['path/to/a/data_folder'])
sentimental.sentiment('Erik is very happy about the nice weather')
>>> {'negative': 0.012843021692660004, 'positive': 0.97922132069306, 'neutral': 0.0079356576142799052}
```

#### Saving and loading a pre-trained model:
Training a model and performing cross-validation can take some time on large datasets. To save time, one a model has been trained it can be saved and later loaded.

```python
sentimental.save('model.pickle')
sentimental2 = Sentimental.load('model.pickle')
```

#### Evaluating the predictor
There are two ways to evaluate Sentimental. The first is by looking at the cross-validation scores:

```python
sentimental.accuracy()
```

The second is to perform validation on an external test set:
```python
sentimental.validate('path/to/validation_files/positive.txt', 'positive')
sentimental.validate('path/to/validation_files/negative.txt', 'negative')
sentimental.validate('path/to/validation_files/neutral.txt', 'neutral')
```

## Data
A sentimental analyzer is only as good as its data. Sentimental comes with some data and pre-trained models. As a bonus the format is very simple and it is easy to train the model on your own data.

For details see the [readme](./sentimental/data/README.md) in the data folder.

If you have good data, either lexicons of polarity words or example sentences, feel free to make a pull request.

## Technical
Sentimental uses Logistic Regression on a ff-idf matrix of n-grams.

## Contributions
Please feel free to make pull requests, especially to add more training data.
