This text tries to explain the concepts of copyright, but this description is not complete, and the editors of Project Runeberg cannot guarantee that it is correct in all parts. Copyright laws may be different in your country, and may change over time.

Copyright is the legal right of an author or artist to decide who may and who may not copy and distribute their works of literature and art. Without laws recognizing this right, it would not be possible for creative people to sell their works to publishers, because any other publisher could just make copies and sell them at a lower price, without paying the author or artist. An author who sits down to write a novel makes a huge investment, because he does not earn any money until the novel is written and sold to a publisher. If we want authors and artists to make this kind of investment, we better respect the laws of copyright.

But copyright is not for ever. Copyright laws grant these rights for the entire lifetime of the author/artist and then for 70 more years (life + 70). Copyright can be sold (to a publisher) or inherited (by the children of the author). When 70 full years have passed after the death of an author, all his works enter the public domain. Some special texts are also exempt of copyright, such as the laws and government decisions that all citizens have to obey.

Works that have more than one author are owned by all authors and artists together. The work enters the public domain when all have been dead for more than 70 years. Works that have no known author or artist enter the public domain 70 years after the year of the first publication. Only creative contributions to a work can merit copyright. Proofreaders do not get copyright to a novel, even if they have made changes to the text, but translators do.

Copyright is almost the same in all countries, but there are small variations, and there have been more variations over time. What is now life+70 used to be life+50. This was changed in Denmark and Sweden in 1995/96 due to a ruling by the European Union, which adopted to German law where life+70 was already used. The same change is expected in the USA in 1998.

Soon after the printing press was invented, printers were granted privilege to print particular works for a period of five or ten years. Other printers who copied the text in this time could be sentenced to fines or prison. Copyright laws as we know them are the results of international agreements by the end of the 19th century. International copyright law is discussed in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which is a branch of the United Nations.

Project Runeberg publishes electronic editions of Nordic literature. In most cases, this means literature by Nordic authors who died more than 70 years ago. You can find out who died when by using Project Runeberg's search page.

When one of Project Runeberg's editions is covered by copyright, a text of warning appears at the top of each page together with the copyright symbol, the letter C in a ring.
